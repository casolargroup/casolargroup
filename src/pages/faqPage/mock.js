    title: 'Will I feel difference  after going Solar? ',
    description:
      "After switching to solar, you won’t notice a difference. All your equipment will work exactly as they did before. The one key difference that you will notice is when you receive a monthly bill from your utility company. How much energy you end up having to buy from your utility depends on the size of your solar system and how much electricity you're actually using. The utility bill is not stable because of the weather and seasonal changes, it will vary from month to month. But you’ll always know exactly what you owe California Solar Group for the duration of the agreement.",
